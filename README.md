# aws-cleanup

This project helps to terminate/delete all the resources in a given AWS account.

This is particularly useful if you are learining to work with AWS & don't want to accidently leave any service in running state only to find out that you have been charged on your credit card at month end.

## Installing

You would require node.js installed on your system to use aws-cleanup. In case its not already installed, you can get it from here: http://nodejs.org/

You can get the code & required modules (including AWS-SDK for node.js) by executing the following commands

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hsachdevah/aws-cleanup.git
cd aws-cleanup
npm install
```
You can execute the cleanup task by running cleanup.js. You would be asked to provide access-key & secret-access-key, please make sure you have all the required permissions for terminating/deleting resources.

```sh
node cleanup.js
```

<strong>Note</strong>: You can also store credentials locally so you don't have to enter them every time you execute the cleanup task. Create a file with name "aws-credentials.json" in the same directory as cleanup.js with the following content

```json
{ 
	"accessKeyId": "<your AWS access key>", 
	"secretAccessKey": "<your AWS secret key>", 
	"region": "us-east-1" 
}
```

The given access key & secret key should have all the permissions to list/delete AWS resources.
